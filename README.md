# creating_tidy_data

The R script "run_analysis.R" creates a tidy data as assigned in "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". The "run_analysis.R" downloads the data into a newly created directory "current_directory/data".

There is also a CodeBook included to explain the variables.

In "tidy_data.txt", one can find the tidy data as warranted in the assignment.
