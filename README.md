# creating_tidy_data

## The R script "run_analysis.R" creates a tidy data as assigned in "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". 
* The "run_analysis.R" downloads the data into a newly created directory "current_directory/data".
* reads test, train, subjects, features, activity etc.
* merges the data into DataSet_1
* extracts the selective measurements(only mean and std) as per the instruction
* calculates the mean of every activity for every subject

## There is also a CodeBook included to explain the variables.

## In "tidy_data.txt", one can find the tidy data as warranted in the assignment.
